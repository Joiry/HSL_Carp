# Differential Expression Analysis

## Motivation

The basic idea behind differential expression analysis is that sequencing of RNA fragments serves as a rough proxy for how much those genes are expressed.

Alignment can be to whole reference sequence or just transcriptome
Transcriptome alignment
Faster â€“ smaller target reference
Implicit filter of non-transcribed reads, if you trust your reference transcriptome
Whole genome alignment
Discover new transcripts not in transcriptome annotation
