Scratch is a special area where you can work with large files, but files are deleted after 36 days.  Let's navigate there using the `cd` command, which stands for *change directory*.  We'll dive in with a slightly complicated command, it requires a few user specific substitutions:

~~~
cd /pine/scr/<a>/<b>/<onyen>
~~~

Replacing `<a>` with the first letter of your onyen, `<b>` with the second letter of your onyen, and as before your onyen for `<onyen>`.  For me, the command is:

~~~
cd /pine/scr/t/r/tristand/
~~~

If your onyen was 'zjdown', the location of your scratch space would be:

`/pine/scr/z/j/zjdown`

Once there, use `pwd` to see your new location, which for my account is:

> ~~~
> /pine/scr/t/r/tristand
> ~~~
